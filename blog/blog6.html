          <div class="blog-content">
            <h2>Nabire: possible year-round, but timing still matters</h2>
            <p>
              Nabire doesn’t look like a classic tourist destination at first — and that’s part of what makes it special.
              From here, you can reach one of Papua’s most remarkable marine experiences: whale shark encounters around the fishing platforms
              (often referred to locally as <em>bagans</em>) in the wider Cenderawasih Bay area.
            </p>

            <p>
              From Nabire, boat trips to the bagans can be organized throughout the year. Sightings are never guaranteed anywhere in the world,
              but the odds here are considered strong — and moon phase can make a noticeable difference.
              Around darker nights (especially near new moon), the bagans often attract more fish, which can increase the chances that whale sharks stay longer.
            </p>

            <img src="/blog/assets/bagan2.jpg" alt="Fishing platforms (bagans) in the bay" />

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Our biggest practical takeaway: if your schedule is flexible, aim for calmer sea conditions and plan around the moon phase rather than choosing dates at random.
              </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h3>How to get to Nabire</h3>
            <p>There are a few common routes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>PELNI ferry:</strong> can be an option, but schedules may change—confirm locally (often via Sorong).</li>
              <li><strong>Flights from Jayapura:</strong> usually the most reliable choice.</li>
              <li><strong>Small propeller aircraft from places like Kaimana / Agats / Dekai:</strong> rare and often weather-dependent.</li>
            </ul>

            <img src="/blog/assets/Flugzeug.jpg" alt="Domestic flights in Papua can be part of the adventure" />

            <h2>Kaimana: spectacular, but not equally reliable all year</h2>
            <p>
              Kaimana is a different kind of highlight. In and around Triton Bay, the scenery can be stunning, and with good conditions
              you may also encounter dolphins and vibrant reefs.
            </p>

            <p>
              But compared to Nabire, Kaimana is much more sensitive to season and sea state. In our case, we visited at the end of August
              and it felt clearly “windy”: rougher water, unstable weather, and no whale shark sightings for us.
              That’s why we eventually decided it made more sense to return to Nabire — even though Kaimana is incredibly appealing in terms of landscapes and culture.
            </p>

            <h3>When to consider Kaimana</h3>
            <p>
              If your priority is calm water and better day-to-day chances for marine activities, it can be worth aligning your route with local conditions
              and planning Kaimana for months that tend to be calmer.
              The difference between “spectacular” and “frustrating” here can come down to timing.
            </p>

            <h2>Quick sea-time summary</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Nabire (Cenderawasih Bay area):</strong> generally possible year-round; moon phase can improve the experience.</li>
              <li><strong>Kaimana (Triton Bay):</strong> can be more seasonal; rougher periods can reduce comfort and chances.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Bonus for divers and ocean lovers</h2>
            <p>
              Across many parts of Indonesia (including Papua), sea conditions and visibility can vary strongly through the year.
              If diving or snorkeling is central to your trip, it’s worth building your itinerary around the calmer windows — and leaving buffer days
              for weather surprises.
            </p>

            <h2>Raja Ampat: getting there, fees, and a smooth arrival</h2>
            <p>
              Raja Ampat is usually reached via a flight to Sorong. From there, you continue by boat to Waisai, the main town in the island group.
              Depending on the day of the week and the season, there are often departures around mid-morning and early afternoon,
              and the crossing typically takes around two hours — but schedules can change, so always double-check close to travel day.
            </p>

            <h3>Arriving in Waisai and park fees</h3>
            <p>
              In Waisai, you’ll need to arrange the local marine park/visitor permit before continuing onward.
              Fees and payment procedures can change over time, so treat any number you hear (including this one) as “typical, but not guaranteed”.
              At the time these routes were commonly discussed, many travelers reported a fee around <strong>IDR 1,000,000</strong> for international visitors.
            </p>

            <p>
              From Waisai, you’ll travel on to your accommodation. Often the accommodation can organize pick-up;
              otherwise there are local boats that function like water taxis.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                One simple tip that saves stress: confirm your pick-up plan with your accommodation before you arrive in Waisai, otherwise it’s easy to feel stuck at the harbor.
              </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Arrive, breathe, and look around</h3>
            <p>
              Once you reach your bungalow, you understand why Raja Ampat has the reputation it does.
              The water can look unreal, and even from the jetty you’ll often spot wildlife — not only in the sea, but also in the trees.
              In our camp, we were visited at night by a cuscus, a nocturnal climbing marsupial found in parts of Papua and the Maluku region.
              Encounters like that make it clear how unique this place is.
            </p>
