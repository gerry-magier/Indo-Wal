          <div class="blog-content">
            <p>
              Malaria and dengue fever — two of the most feared diseases in Papua.
              And yes, we each caught one of them.
            </p>

            <p>
              Jokes aside, there was absolutely nothing funny about it.
            </p>

            <h2>Dengue fever: my experience</h2>
            <p>
              For me, it started suddenly with intense shivering attacks.
              I was freezing so badly that I needed multiple blankets, even with room temperatures above 25°C.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Complete loss of appetite</li>
              <li>Constant exhaustion</li>
              <li>Sleeping almost all day</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              I was convinced it had to be malaria. In Kaimana, I went to a small hospital, but the malaria test came back negative.
              We continued traveling to Nabire, and while I was still extremely weak, I was technically able to move.
            </p>

            <p>
              After several days to about a week, the symptoms slowly improved. What remained were:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Persistent cough</li>
              <li>No appetite at all</li>
              <li>Zero energy</li>
              <li>A skin rash that still hasn’t fully disappeared</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Typical dengue symptoms include severe joint and limb pain, intense headaches, very high fever
              (mine reached up to 40°C), and extreme pain behind the eyes.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Dengue fever is not a harmless illness. Period.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <img src="/blog/assets/dengue.jpg" alt="Dengue fever recovery phase" />

            <h2>Malaria: Gerret’s experience — and why it was dangerous</h2>
            <p>
              What Gerret experienced went far beyond that.
              It started in Raja Ampat with repeated vomiting, complete loss of appetite,
              constant sleeping, and a yellowish discoloration of his face.
            </p>

            <p>
              At first, we assumed it was either the same illness I had or a food-related infection.
              After returning to Sorong and seeing no improvement for two days, we flew on to Ambon.
            </p>

            <p>
              Only there did we go to a hospital — and that was almost too late.
            </p>

            <p>
              The test was positive for malaria tropica, the most dangerous form of malaria.
              The main risk is severe dehydration, as any intake of food or liquids is immediately lost again.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Critically low red blood cell and platelet levels</li>
              <li>Severe gas buildup in the abdomen</li>
              <li>Extreme physical weakness</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              We stayed in the hospital for five days before he was discharged.
              Even afterward, normal travel was impossible.
              Small efforts — a short walk or a slight incline — forced him to lie down again.
            </p>

            <h2>Health insurance and prevention: our strongest advice</h2>
            <p>
              We had international health insurance.
              Without it, we would have faced serious problems.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Never travel to Papua without proper international health insurance.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              Regarding malaria prophylaxis: yes, it makes sense if you can afford it
              and are informed about possible side effects.
              We didn’t take it due to time and cost constraints.
            </p>

            <p>
              Looking back, the malaria risk in Papua is extremely high.
              Every single person we spoke to locally had malaria at least once — often multiple times.
            </p>

            <h2>What we learned about health in Papua</h2>
            <p>
              Papua is not a typical travel destination.
              That’s exactly why health risks should never be underestimated.
            </p>

            <h3>Mosquito prevention: essential, but not foolproof</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Strong insect repellent with high DEET concentration</li>
              <li>Long, breathable clothing, especially evenings and nights</li>
              <li>Mosquito net if accommodation doesn’t provide one</li>
              <li>Mosquito coils or electric vaporizers</li>
              <li>Showering before sleep to reduce attracting scents</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Even with all this: 100% protection in Papua is unrealistic.
              You can reduce risk — but not eliminate it.
            </p>

            <h3>High-risk areas (from our experience)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Remote jungle regions</li>
              <li>Mangrove areas (Asmat region, parts of Kaimana)</li>
              <li>Places with stagnant water</li>
              <li>Small villages with very limited medical access</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              In cities like Jayapura, Sorong, or Timika, basic medical care exists.
              In places like Dekai or Agats, every hour can matter in an emergency.
            </p>

            <h2>When to go to the hospital immediately</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>High fever (around 39°C or higher)</li>
              <li>Severe chills</li>
              <li>Persistent vomiting</li>
              <li>Extreme weakness or confusion</li>
              <li>Yellowing of skin or eyes</li>
              <li>Severe joint, head, or eye pain</li>
            </ul>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Don’t wait. Don’t google. Go to the hospital.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Our final thoughts on health and travel in Papua</h2>
            <p>
              Papua is wild, beautiful, intense, emotional, and unique.
              But it’s not a place for carelessness.
            </p>

            <p>
              With preparation, respect, and awareness, it can offer incredible experiences.
              Without those, it can become dangerous very quickly.
            </p>

            <p>
              If this account helps even one person seek medical care earlier
              or prepare more seriously, then writing it was worth it.
            </p>

            <h2>Final reflection: Papua</h2>
            <p>
              Papua often feels like it should be its own country —
              not only because many locals wish for that,
              but because of its cultural diversity, languages, and entirely different realities of life.
            </p>

            <p>
              It’s less developed, less comfortable, and far less adapted.
              But also more honest.
            </p>

            <p>
              Papua is not for everyone.
              But for those willing to embrace uncertainty, improvisation, and radically different ways of life,
              it’s a place that leaves a lasting mark.
