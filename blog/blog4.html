          <div class="blog-content">
            <h2>From Jayapura to Dekai</h2>
            <p>
              From Jayapura, there is only one daily flight to Dekai — and only one flight back. We flew to Dekai on 16 August.
              That date would later become surprisingly important.
            </p>

            <p>
              Even before boarding, it was clear: this would not feel like a normal domestic flight.
              To travel to Dekai at all, you need a travel permit called a <strong>Surat Jalan</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2>Surat Jalan: a mandatory permit for travel in Papua</h2>
            <p>
              Papua is officially considered a sensitive region where armed conflict can occur. The government often describes these situations as disputes between different tribes.
              On the ground, however — and through what we experienced ourselves — it can also involve tensions between local groups and the Indonesian government or military.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can usually obtain the Surat Jalan at a police station, for example in Jayapura or Sorong.
              We simply went to the first station we saw, greeted the officers in Indonesian, and explained our plan.
              They looked genuinely happy to help.
            </p>

            <p>
              They only needed our passports and 100,000 Rupiah. Less than five minutes later, we had our Surat Jalan in hand.
              Meanwhile, we were standing next to a cassowary. At that moment, it really sank in: we were truly in Papua.
            </p>

            <h2>Arriving in Dekai: a reality check</h2>
            <p>
              With the permit in our bag, we boarded the plane to Dekai. The airport is tiny — more like a runway carved into the jungle.
              Right after landing, the military was already waiting.
            </p>

            <p>
              It was a strange feeling. The soldiers watched us closely, immediately asked for the Surat Jalan, and then told us we needed to come to the local station first.
            </p>

            <p>
              Dekai isn’t a “town” in the way most people imagine — it’s closer to a small village with fewer than 4,000 residents, deep in Papua’s interior.
              From here, many tours to the Korowai normally begin. That was our plan too: find a local guide and start the journey.
            </p>

            <h2>Transport and the first warning signs</h2>
            <p>
              Within the first minutes, we noticed: everything works differently here.
              For a five-minute ride on a motorbike taxi, we paid 100,000 Rupiah per person.
              Neither our fluent Indonesian nor any negotiation changed the price. It was fixed.
            </p>

            <p>
              That was the first clear sign that Dekai can’t be compared to other places in Indonesia.
            </p>

            <h2>Military instead of police — and the end of our plan</h2>
            <p>
              At the station, we were greeted by a visibly irritated man. It quickly became clear: this wasn’t a normal police interaction.
              This was the military.
            </p>

            <p>
              We were told very directly that our plan to visit the Korowai was not feasible. In the previous weeks, there had been several “rebel attacks,”
              and one incident had reportedly ended with a rebel being killed.
            </p>

            <p>
              We panicked. The officer continued: our Surat Jalan should never have been issued in the first place.
              The permit is meant to be issued only after the station contacts local authorities and checks the current security situation.
              Apparently, that hadn’t happened in Jayapura.
            </p>

            <p>
              Nobody explicitly ordered us — but the message was clear: we should fly back to Jayapura the next day.
              The problem was that the next day was <strong>17 August</strong>, Indonesia’s Independence Day, and there were no flights at all.
            </p>

            <h2>One night at George’s place</h2>
            <p>
              The next question was simple and existential: where would we sleep?
              Dekai felt saturated with the military — if I had to guess, over 200 armed soldiers.
            </p>

            <p>
              Luckily, we met George, the local English teacher. He had studied in New Zealand on a scholarship.
              His English wasn’t perfect anymore — but his openness and generosity were.
              He invited us to sleep at his home. We had a tent and sleeping mats with us; in the end, we only needed the mats.
            </p>

            <h3>A practical note on accommodation in Papua</h3>
            <p>
              Many houses in Papua are intentionally built with open sections for airflow — gaps or partially open walls.
              The downside is mosquitoes.
            </p>

            <p>
              Mosquito coils are common and are meant to smolder through the night. We used them too —
              and still, I later got malaria. We’ll share more in our Raja Ampat report.
            </p>

            <p>
              This isn’t meant to scare anyone, but to underline that malaria risk is something you need to take seriously when traveling in Papua.
            </p>

            <h2>Dekai up close: between curiosity and uncertainty</h2>
            <p>
              Together with George, we explored the village. For the first time on our entire trip through Indonesia, I didn’t feel truly safe.
              Eyes followed us everywhere.
            </p>

            <p>
              George told us we were the first tourists in months. Armed pickup trucks drove through the streets —
              according to George, they belonged to local gold miners.
            </p>

            <p>
              Still, we also had positive encounters. We spoke with locals and invited some of them for food.
            </p>

            <img src="/blog/assets/kinderessen.jpg" alt="Sharing a meal and meeting locals in Dekai" />

            <p>
              A small spark of hope appeared when people told us the authorities might be exaggerating the situation —
              and that some tour guides allegedly pay fees to pass through.
              Even though corruption isn’t an unknown topic in Indonesia, this did not feel like something we wanted to rely on.
            </p>

            <p>
              That evening, we visited a Korowai family whose children had been sent to Dekai for school.
              We were told repeatedly that the Korowai village itself was safe — but also that the long boat journey there could be controlled by rebels.
            </p>

            <h2>17 August in Dekai: a quiet holiday</h2>
            <p>
              So we spent Indonesia’s Independence Day in Dekai. Usually, this day is full of celebrations, games, and flags everywhere.
              Here, it felt completely different.
            </p>

            <p>
              The only Indonesian flag we saw was on the grounds of the station.
              Many residents of Dekai no longer feel part of Indonesia, and instead wish for their own state — similar to Papua New Guinea.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion: two unforgettable days in Dekai</h2>
            <p>
              Even though we couldn’t reach our original goal of visiting the Korowai, these two days in Dekai became one of the most intense experiences of our trip.
            </p>

            <p>
              Not because of jungle adventure — but because of the reality on the ground: political tension, uncertainty,
              and the humanity we still experienced in the middle of it all.
