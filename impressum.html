      <h3>Liability for Links</h3>
      <p>
        Our website contains links to external websites of third parties over whose content we have no control.
        Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator
        of the linked pages is always responsible for their content. The linked pages were checked for possible legal
        violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Permanent monitoring of the content of linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation.
        Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.
