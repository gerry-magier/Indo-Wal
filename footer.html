    <div class="privacy-head">
      <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
      <button class="icon-btn" id="closeAgb" type="button" aria-label="Close Terms and Conditions">✕</button>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-body">
      <h3>1. Scope of Application</h3>
      <p>
        These Terms and Conditions apply to all bookings of blue whale tours in Timor-Leste made via our website,
        by email, or in text form (Section 126b German Civil Code – BGB). By placing a booking, the customer accepts
        these Terms and Conditions as binding.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Contract Conclusion and Payment</h3>
      <ul class="clean">
        <li>Bookings are made via our online booking form or in text form.</li>
        <li>The contract is concluded when the customer receives our booking confirmation.</li>
        <li>The total price is due immediately upon conclusion of the contract.</li>
        <li>Participation is only possible after full payment has been received.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Prices and Payment Methods</h3>
      <ul class="clean">
        <li>All prices are stated in euros and include applicable taxes.</li>
        <li>Accepted payment methods are PayPal and bank transfer.</li>
        <li>The price confirmed at the time of booking applies. Price changes after contract conclusion are excluded.</li>
        <li>Prices depend on tour duration. The total price is fixed and independent of the number of participants.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Cancellation by the Customer</h3>
      <h4>4.1 Cancellation Fees</h4>
      <p>
        The customer may withdraw from the contract at any time before the start of the tour. The decisive factor is
        the receipt of the cancellation notice by the provider. In this case, the following cancellation fees apply:
      </p>
      <ul class="clean">
        <li><strong>up to and including 60 days before tour start:</strong> 50% of the total price</li>
        <li><strong>less than 60 days before tour start or no-show:</strong> 100% of the total price</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The customer may provide evidence that no damage or a substantially lower damage was incurred by the provider.
      </p>

      <h4>4.2 No Right of Withdrawal</h4>
      <p>
        For consumers from the European Union, there is no right of withdrawal pursuant to Section 312g(2) No. 9 BGB,
        as this is a leisure service provided for a specific date.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Cancellation or Changes by the Provider</h3>
      <ul class="clean">
        <li>
          The provider is entitled to cancel or modify tours for safety reasons or due to force majeure
          (e.g., extreme weather conditions, strong currents, natural events).
        </li>
        <li>
          In such cases, the customer may choose between an alternative date and a refund of the tour price already paid.
        </li>
        <li>Further claims are excluded to the extent permitted by law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6. Liability</h3>
      <ul class="clean">
        <li>Participation in tours is at the participant's own risk.</li>
        <li>The provider is fully liable in cases of intent and gross negligence.</li>
        <li>
          In cases of slight negligence, the provider is only liable for breaches of essential contractual obligations
          (cardinal duties) and limited to foreseeable, typical contractual damages.
        </li>
        <li>Liability for damages resulting from injury to life, body, or health remains unaffected.</li>
        <li>
          The provider is not liable for risks arising from participant behavior, natural events, or the unpredictable behavior of animals.
        </li>
        <li>We strongly recommend taking out sufficient travel, accident, and health insurance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7. On-site Risk and Liability Information</h3>
      <ul class="clean">
        <li>
          Before the tour begins, all participants are required to sign a risk and liability information form,
          which explains the particular risks of a boat tour in the open sea.
        </li>
        <li>
          This form serves to inform about risks and does not exclude liability for intent, gross negligence,
          or damages to life, body, or health.
        </li>
        <li>
          If signing is refused, participation may be denied. In such case, no refund is due if the exclusion is attributable to the customer.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>8. Participant Duties and Health Requirements</h3>
      <ul class="clean">
        <li>Participants must follow all safety and behavioral instructions given by the crew and guides.</li>
        <li>Ability to swim and sufficient physical and health fitness are required.</li>
        <li>
          The provider or guide may exclude participants from the tour for safety reasons if there are obvious health or safety concerns.
        </li>
        <li>If exclusion is due to reasons attributable to the participant, no refund is due.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>9. Substitute Participant / Transfer of Booking</h3>
      <p>
        Transfer of a booking to a substitute participant is only possible with prior consent of the provider.
        There is no entitlement to such consent.
      </p>

      <h3>10. Choice of Law and International Customers</h3>
      <ul class="clean">
        <li>The law of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste applies.</li>
        <li>
          For consumers habitually resident in the European Union, mandatory consumer protection provisions
          of the country of residence remain unaffected.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>11. Final Provisions</h3>
      <ul class="clean">
        <li>Changes to these Terms and Conditions apply only to future bookings.</li>
        <li>
          If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is or becomes wholly or partially invalid, the validity of the remaining provisions remains unaffected.
        </li>
      </ul>
