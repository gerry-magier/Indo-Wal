      </p>

      <h3>2. Contract Subject / Services</h3>

        <li>Meals as stated in the tour description (e.g., full or partial board).</li>
        <li>Accommodation as stated in the tour description (e.g., homestays/camps/lodges; basic standards may apply in remote areas).</li>
        <li>Organisation/logistics and, where stated, required local permits.</li>
      </ul>

      </ul>

      <h3>3. Contract Conclusion and Payment</h3>
      <ul class="clean">
        <li>Bookings are made via our online booking form, by email, or in text form.</li>
        <li>The contract is concluded when the customer receives our booking confirmation.</li>
        <li>The total price is due immediately upon conclusion of the contract (unless agreed otherwise in writing).</li>
        <li>Participation is only possible after full payment has been received.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Prices and Payment Methods</h3>
      <ul class="clean">
        <li>All prices are stated in euros and include applicable taxes/charges unless stated otherwise.</li>
        <li>Accepted payment methods are PayPal and bank transfer unless agreed otherwise.</li>
        <li>The price confirmed at the time of booking applies. Price changes after contract conclusion are excluded.</li>
        <li>Prices may depend on duration/route/logistics; the tour description and booking confirmation are decisive.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Cancellation by the Customer</h3>
      <h4>5.1 Cancellation fees (identical to the Timor-Leste tour)</h4>
      <p>
        The customer may withdraw from the contract at any time before the start of the Tour. The decisive factor is
        the receipt of the cancellation notice by the Provider. The following cancellation fees apply:
      </p>
      <ul class="clean">
        <li><strong>up to and including 60 days before tour start:</strong> 50% of the total price</li>
        <li><strong>less than 60 days before tour start or no-show:</strong> 100% of the total price</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The customer may provide evidence that no damage or a substantially lower damage was incurred by the Provider.
        Refunds for unused services (e.g., missed days/transfers/meals) are excluded to the extent permitted by law.
      </p>

      <h4>5.2 No right of withdrawal</h4>
      <p>
        For consumers from the European Union, there is no right of withdrawal pursuant to Section 312g(2) No. 9 BGB,
        as this is a leisure service provided for a specific date/period.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Changes, Adjustments and Cancellation by the Provider</h3>
      <p>
        Papua expeditions may take place in remote regions with limited infrastructure. Routes, timings and activities can be adjusted
        for safety, weather, logistical or governmental reasons. The Provider is entitled to modify, reroute, reschedule or (partly) cancel tours,
        in particular due to:
      </p>
      <ul class="clean">
        <li>extreme weather, strong currents, natural events/disasters, force majeure,</li>
        <li>governmental orders/permit situations, security risks, local unrest, road closures,</li>
        <li>failures of local transportation (e.g., boat/vehicle/local charter), illness/injury of key personnel,</li>
        <li>medical emergencies or other circumstances affecting safe operation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In such cases, the Provider will, where possible, offer an alternative date or a reasonable substitute service.
        If this is not possible or not reasonable, the customer may request a refund of tour services already paid.
        Further claims (e.g., reimbursement of flight costs) are excluded to the extent permitted by law.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Entry Requirements, Documents and Customer Duties</h3>
      <ul class="clean">
        <li>The customer is responsible for a valid passport, visas, entry requirements, vaccinations and any required permits.</li>
        <li>The Provider may request required information (e.g., passport data) and share it with local partners/authorities where necessary to operate the tour.</li>
        <li>If entry/participation requirements are not met, participation may be denied; no refund will be due in such case.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>8. Health, Fitness and Expedition-Specific Risks</h3>
      <p>
        Tours can be physically demanding and may take place in remote areas with limited medical care.
        The customer confirms they are fit to participate and understands the specific risks of an expedition
        (e.g., jungle terrain, heat, heavy rain, rivers, uneven ground, boat travel, local transport).
      </p>
      <ul class="clean">
        <li>The customer is responsible for their personal health and appropriate equipment.</li>
        <li>The Provider/guide may exclude participants or restrict activities for safety reasons if health or safety concerns are evident.</li>
        <li>If exclusion or early termination is due to reasons attributable to the participant (e.g., lack of fitness, ignoring instructions), no refund is due.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>9. Insurance (strongly recommended / may be required)</h3>
      <p>
        For Papua tours, the following insurance is <strong>strongly</strong> recommended and may be required depending on tour profile:
      </p>
      <ul class="clean">
        <li>Travel health insurance <strong>including medical evacuation</strong> (e.g., charter/heli where available) and repatriation,</li>
        <li>Accident insurance,</li>
        <li>Trip cancellation and trip interruption/curtailment insurance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Costs arising from illness, accident, evacuation, return travel or treatment are borne by the customer unless caused by the Provider.
      </p>

      <h3>10. Conduct, Safety and Cultural Respect</h3>
      <ul class="clean">
        <li>Participants must follow all safety and behavioural instructions given by guides and crew.</li>
        <li>Respectful behaviour towards local communities/indigenous groups is mandatory; cultural rules must be followed.</li>
        <li>Alcohol/drug abuse and aggressive, discriminatory or dangerous behaviour may lead to exclusion.</li>
        <li>The customer is liable for damages caused by them (e.g., accommodation, equipment, third-party property).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>11. Liability</h3>
      <ul class="clean">
        <li>Participation in tours is at the participant’s own risk.</li>
        <li>The Provider is fully liable in cases of intent and gross negligence.</li>
        <li>
          In cases of slight negligence, the Provider is only liable for breaches of essential contractual obligations (cardinal duties)
          and limited to foreseeable, typical contractual damages.
        </li>
        <li>Liability for damages resulting from injury to life, body, or health remains unaffected.</li>
        <li>
          The Provider is not liable for events/damages caused by force majeure, natural events, animal behaviour, governmental measures,
          security situations or participant behaviour, to the extent permitted by law.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Provider is not liable for services/delays/failures of third parties (e.g., local transport providers) unless expressly assumed as an own obligation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>12. Early Termination / Evacuation / Return</h3>
      <ul class="clean">
        <li>If the customer ends the tour early or does not use services, no (partial) refund is due.</li>
        <li>
          Additional costs resulting from early termination, return travel or necessary evacuation are borne by the customer,
          unless caused by the Provider.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the tour must be ended for safety reasons or force majeure, the Provider will seek reasonable alternatives; claims follow Section 6 where legally permitted.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>13. Photo and Media Notice (optional)</h3>
      <p>
        Photos/videos may be taken during the tour for documentation purposes. Use for marketing purposes will only occur
        if the customer has not objected or has provided separate consent. Objections can be made at any time in text form.
      </p>

      <h3>14. Data Protection</h3>
      <p>
        Information on the processing of personal data is set out in our Privacy Policy.

      </p>

      <h3>15. Governing Law and Consumer Rights</h3>
      <ul class="clean">
        <li>German law applies. Mandatory consumer protection provisions of the customer’s country of habitual residence remain unaffected.</li>
        <li>Jurisdiction is, where legally permissible, the Provider’s registered seat.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>16. Final Provisions</h3>
      <ul class="clean">
        <li>Changes to these Terms and Conditions apply only to future bookings.</li>
        <li>
          If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is or becomes wholly or partially invalid,
          the validity of the remaining provisions remains unaffected.
        </li>
      </ul>
